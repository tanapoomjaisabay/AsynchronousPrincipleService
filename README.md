# AsynchronousPrincipleService

A demonstration project illustrating different asynchronous execution patterns between two distributed .NET 9 services: `ServiceA` and `ServiceB`.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Purpose

The objective of this project is to demonstrate **three distinct robot creation patterns** through asynchronous communication between two independent services:

1. **CreateRobotWithSequence**  
   ServiceA calls ServiceB sequentially. Each call to ServiceB must complete before proceeding to the next operation.

2. **CreateRobotWithParallel**  
   ServiceA initiates multiple asynchronous calls to ServiceB without awaiting them immediately. After all calls have been issued, ServiceA then awaits the responses collectively before proceeding.

3. **ScheduleRobotCreation**  
   ServiceA invokes ServiceB in a fire-and-forget manner. It does not await any response from ServiceB and immediately continues its own workflow, returning a response to the client once its local tasks are complete.

These scenarios provide practical insights into how different asynchronous strategies impact the responsiveness, scalability, and resource management of microservice-based systems.
